# Alternate Logic Via Python Script

This is a test project I developed while learning how I might implement alternate logic for a MongoDB update using a Python script in lieu of "standard" logic found in a C# application. It is very rough and breaks plenty of good practices I'm sure. I'm still very green on MongoDB as of writing this so there's that too.

Below are just links I kept that were helpful while working through this.
